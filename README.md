# genApiDocGo

**genApiDocGo** is an open-source tool written in Go for generating API documentation in Swagger's JSON format. Itâ€™s primarily designed for use with Express.js frameworks, allowing for automatic extraction and documentation of HTTP routes and methods.

We plan to add more languages and frameworks in the future.

## Features

- **Automatic Documentation**: Extracts API endpoint information directly from the code.
- **Supports Swagger JSON Format**: Generates Swagger-compatible JSON files for easy integration with tools like Swagger UI.
- **Express.js Compatibility**: Designed to work with Express.js-based projects, enabling quick documentation generation.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> You must have Go version 1.22 installed.  

At the moment to use it, you have to download and run it. 
```sh
go run ./src/ <path_project_to_doc> 
```

## Example

Given a route: 
```js
// @api_generate_doc
/* Description */
or 
/**
 * Description
 */
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  // Endpoint code here
});
```
**genApiDocGo** will extract and document the route, generating a Swagger JSON entry for it.
